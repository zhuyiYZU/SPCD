You seemed to be confused on who actually is Latino and this seems to be your main point of debate. Going by your logic the pages Anglo-Celtic Australian and Black Australian should be drawn into question as they are also not referenced in the Australian Census. The rest of the page shouldn't need citations and references as no more information than what is available in the census is really given. And how exactly am I wrong? ``I'm not saying that your entirely wrong`` Again this opinion seems to me, to have come from your belief that I am not aware of what or who a Latino is, and in my opinion, no offense intended, is due to yourself not grasping the concept of a Latino. My view is further strengethed by your comment: ``I think it's dubious to list people because they're of Latin American descent all down as 'Latino Australian' when they are in fact of different ancestral, ethnic and national backgrounds.`` This is exactly what Latinos are, of different ancestral, ethnic and national backgrounds.

0, *'Oppose Removal After reading the above comments and looking at some of the users pages it becomes apparent that that deletion is an attempt to silence the oppossition and promote a POV. As an American historian I see that there is strong support for gun ownership rights and has there been for centuries. Many Americans see this as a valid argument against gun control and in America it is not a fringe theory. The article is about Gun Control and one could infer American Gun control because it is no longer an issue in most other countries. The argument has legs and to deny that is to deny history for political motivations. Whether or not we agree with the argument is irrelevant. History is not about voting on current policies. The proper thing to due is to have arguments for and against the viewpoint and not to bury it because like a zombie it will rise again. Also I am concerned that Wikipedia has become a platform for many editors to promote their politics and I am sure this statement will bring the POV pushers out as an accurate assessment often does.

Please see the section immediately above this article. Or better yet, spend the next 24 hours reading the first sections of Sein und Zeit and you will see the ridiculousness of the article as it currently stands, which demonstrates no understanding of Heidegger, and leaves everyone who reads it dumber than  when they began and knowing less about everything. This is so atrocious that essentially the entire article as it stands needs to be deleted and began again. I have no more time for this.      I tried to move the Dreyfus to the main article and now apparently all the material is destroyed. Do you have any comprehension of how bad this article currently is? One would have no idea that Heidegger was ever read anywhere outside of France from the current article. No summaries of Heidegger's important concepts are given. No understanding of any of Heidegger's ideas are conveyed. Since you have decided to destroy my work, you can keep your poor article, which reads as if it was machine-translated from a foreign language. You do not even let someone in the middle of working finish before you destroy their work. No wonder zero academics contribute to this site and your articles are so atrocious. Anyone who reads the article as it currently stands comes away knowing less about Heidegger than they did before because of all of the obvious distortions and gross inaccuracies. You have not even succesfully explained a single one of Heidegger's terms or concepts here, or why anyone should care who he is. This article is an embarassment indeed.    Words are important rather than space on the screen because people have different size screens. I have a 27 inch screen and a 5 inch screen, both of which I edit on. The lead is the same amount of words on both screens, but not the same number of ``screens`` for two different users. Word counts give a reasonable approximation of length not dependent on the particularities of users devices, fonts, and other non-content formatting. Generally, essays list word limits not page limits so page limits aren't just fudged with font changes and others.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by   •   `"

My discussion went off on a tangent with Malik Shabazz when it really should have included you as well. The Jean Claude Baker book on Josephine Baker seems biased and unacceptable. For example, he states at the beginning that he ``hated her`` and refers to himself eighteen times on the first page. Since he did not meet her until she was 52 it seems inappropriate to rely on his claims about her life when she was 20 or 30. The blanket statement ``Baker was bisexual,`` written as if it indisputable, really has to go, don't you think? There is no evidence given except the claim of a fan who changed his name to hitch onto her celebrity. Doesn't this kind of TMZ gossip presented as fact diminish the biographies of people who have the courage to acknowledge their sexuality up front?  `"

0,"`  == Invitation to comment: Formatting changes to WP:DISCOGSTYLE. ==  Hello. I'm not sure how much you know or care about the formatting changes brewing for discogs, but as you edit a lot of music-related articles I'd like to invite you and your otters to drop a word or two at the link shown at the bottom of my ``brief`` summary.  Quick summary: Over at the Talk page for WP:WikiProject Discographies/style, there's been quite a bit of (at times tedious and technical) discussion about the formatting of discographies. Although WikiProject Discographies/style hopes to be part of the Manual of Style some day, it does not, currently, conform to WP:ACCESS, itself a part of the MoS. This is a problem because articles which conform to the WikiProject Discographies/style ought not be acceptable for promotion to FA or FL status, since they don't conform to the MoS.  After much discussion at Accessibility issues, followed by what was meant to be a conclusion at Time to update, we would be ready to actively address the problem, with discographies eventually being reformatted to appear as currently shown here (already changed from its earlier form). Column order and formatting would be noticeably changed, chart headings would typically be bigger, a few other differences in the coding would be made.  The only hold-up (as far as we know) is lack of wider consensus; I think too few people have participated and I'd like to see more editors register their opinion (be it support or criticism) before we move ahead with a rather significant change. (At the very least, you may consider this fair warning.) Your comment is welcome at Are we ready to apply this updated guideline?. Thanks. —   `"

We don't have Lebanese, Syrian or Tunisian people forcible redirected to the ``Arabs`` article, so why can't we have these pages then? ``The page is not Assyrian propaganda, it's just facts, evidences etc.`` Of course it is otherwise we wouldn't argue about it!

The author seems discriminatory against certain info. I find this not in keeping with wiki's universal policy. I had no choice but to create an modified article. For example, a particular castle in Spain is now called, 'King Charles V's Castle'. The old and unused name of the castle is, 'Alcázar of Segovia'. Everyone in Spain calls this castle by, 'King Charles V's Castle', not 'Alcazar of Segovia'. The author refuses to accept this fact, though I provided solid sources supporting this historic truth. The author is biased against Spanish historical inferences for reasons I have yet to understand. He is not flexible. If he can remove his biasness, and allow me to add my info backed by sources, then I will not create a new article.

Since they were made by an anon without a history of previous vandalism, and they all happened within ten minutes and many hours ago, I doubt that anything would be achieved by blocked the IP address. I've placed a warning on their talk page, but the chances are, they'll never see it because they got bored with vandalising Wikipedia and moved on.  When you warn someone for this sort of activity, please put your warning on their talk page, not their user page. Only a message posted to the talk page generates the ``You have new messages`` sign for them. Most vandals stop when they see this message.  Thanks for alerting me about this anon.- `"

0,"`  == ``Jesus and Messianic prophecy`` ==  Hey. I don't know if this is technically where I should be posting this; sorry if it's not.  1) Fine, if ``retort`` isn't 100% appropriate then I'll use ``counter-argue``- that is the meaning I was trying to get across.  But I think all your other points are too strict and therefore not in keeping with Wikipedia's guidelines or encyclopedia guidelines in general.  2) You said: ``Christians retort that the messianic prophecies never specified a time-line for the Messiah's actions, and the New Testament, especially the Book of Revelation, detail how some of the prophecies will come to fruition later. . This is a bit vague and raises some questions. Which Christians? Where did they say that? How did they detail it? Can you reference it from a notable/semi-notable scholar?``  First, I can't point to a place in the Old Testament where the time-line DOESN'T exist, you know what I mean? There is no Jewish time-line so it cannot be referenced. But the New Testament does have a Christian time-line, as detailed in the Book of Revelation. Now, which Christians hold to this belief? Essentially all of them- all that have a moderate to literal interpretation of the Bible, which is essentially all. Where did Christian authors detail this belief? In the Bible! How did they detail it? They wrote it in the Bible!!! That is why I made Bible references! Which scholar can I quote? How about John the Apostle, who wrote Revelation? Is one of the founders of Christianity an acceptable source on the subject?  I find you taking objection to this equivalent to someone writing, ``Christians believe Jesus came back from the dead, as detailed in various places, including the gospels,`` and then you coming around asking for scholarly sources and not accepting Bible passages and asking, ``which Christians believe that?``.   3) You said: This includes Jesus ruling an earthly paradise after the apocalypse (Revelation 19-22). , although it does reference The Bible, if left alone, it sounds rather confusing. It also does not specifically reference a line from Revelation, nor does it reference which version of The Bible it quotes (King James, NIV, etc) which could mean a slight difference in the quote.   If you want many specific Bible quotes then I'll put those in, and I'll list if its KJV or whatever. But I don't think that's required as my broad citation of Rev 19-22 does clearly explain exactly what I'm talking about, including a physical kingdom on earth, a messianic age of righteousness and so on. Just because I didn't dissect it and show a specific line for each point doesn't mean they aren't there- any interested reader can easily find them by reading those chapters.  If I had written, ``The story of Noah's Ark is in Genesis 6-9,`` would you have deleted my entry and said its citation is too vague? Just because I didn't give a synopsis with ten references doesn't mean it's unworthy; just look it up!   4) What bothers me most is how this whole thing started when I tried to correct incorrect data on your site (the line that Christians don't believe in a physical resurrection). That line had NO references! So even if my references are vague they still trump the initial post, don't they? You can't delete my post for dubious citation then restore something with no references at all.  5) I'm sure you'll disagree with me on this one, but most of all, I think that my contribution didn't need to cite ANYTHING as it is such common knowledge that Christians believe in Judgment Day, an age of peace etc. I feel like I'm in some kind of twilight zone defending this belief.   It's almost as bad as someone posting, ``Christians don't believe Jesus was tried, executed and came back to life,`` then I post that they do, citing Luke 20-24, then you saying that it is too vague etc. It was pure courtesy to give the citation- it's such common knowledge that Christians believe these things!  But whatever- I'll repost with a several more-specific quotes. And BTW, you may think, ``Whoa, this guy care WAY too much about Wikipedia (and I'm a mod),`` but this is about preventing my religion from being misrepresented. (And I hate inconsistency.)    `"

For an up to date response to MWI from the viewpoint of pilot wave theory, I would recommend:  http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0811/0811.0810v2.pdf  To respond briefly to a couple of points that Dvtausk made earlier, note that I am not saying that particles are hidden—don’t misquote me!—merely that for Bohm the hidden variables were in fact hidden (in spite of loose statements by Bell and others that the particles “are” the hidden variables).  The point here being that much of the confusion on this talk page and in the article has to do with confusion surrounding the basic concepts with which we talk about particles, observables, hidden variables and so forth.  The “hidden variable” section in the current article, for instance, does little to explain what Bohm himself understood by “hidden variables” or why in the world he called his first approach ‘an interpretation in terms of hidden variables.’  Regarding PSI squared and equilibrium thermodynamics, the passage from Bohm is the starting point but already in 1952b (Bohm’s initial response to the “measurement problem”) you have chaotic motions of the subquantum level, and the then there is the article in 1953 where he lays out his own view of how to interpret the Born rule (aka quantum equilibrium hypothesis), and finally you have the Bohm-Vigier hydrodynamic model which explicitly incorporates a stochastic element above and beyond the “deterministic chaos” approach.  But again, for Bohm, the important thing about the rule is that it provides a measure of the probability of a particle actually “being “somewhere-(think beables) rather than “finding” a particle somewhere (think observables).    Also, what is interesting about the Bohm approach is not so much that through p=Psi squared you come to the same results as CI, but rather that it can account for situations in which p does not equal Psi-squared.  Valentini has some interesting comments along these lines which at least brings the theory in line with non-equilibrium thermodynamics and modern cosmology.    Signing off for the weekend.

0,"` Since nobody has thought it necessary to post a count before concluding the deletion request, I'll do it.   :Keep: 5 :Merge all: 2 :Merge, but keep some:7 :Delete: 0  This means that the original deletion request was rejected. I want to thank everybody for this unanimous vote, because it attests that my contributions were valid.   Actually this appeared quite clear from the start as even the originator of the request, , has never cast a vote for deletion. His vote is Merge, but keep some.  Thus remains the question why the deletion request was filed at all. I think that  had every right to question the utility of the pages created. He was also right trying to influence the further development of the project. There is an instrument on Wikipedia to do that. It is called Talk page.   However he decided on another instrument without ever contacting me and this gave a number of people, who had never taken any interest in the argument, the power to interfere. What followed has been called a ``mess`` by  and I would rather agree with his definition.   More precisely, I'd tend to call the procedure an abuse, since it has been wielded to install a kind of preventive democratic control over how users have to submit their contributions to Wikipedia, which is certainly not the purpose of a deletion request.   According to the spirit of the compromise reached and to judge from the messages posted on the single talk pages, it is now in the competence of the admins to decide which articles on ancient athletes are permitted, how many and why. Thus everything has been burocraticized and as a consequence the whole area of research has been transformed into a minefield. So who would ever touch it again?  This approach hasn't worked in the past and it never will. Probably these power plays are also among the motives for the loss of so many valid editors whose enthusiasm must have vanished for a reason. As long as these stupid games have the better, I'm afraid the future looks bleak. Wikipedia can only survive as a free encyclopedia and today we have lost some of that freedom.  After many words, here is the body count of today's battle:  This user has stopped contributing to Wikipedia.  What I leave on the field is a rudimentary list of Olympic winners, thirty-five marginal articles with a merge tag and an incomplete calendar which is currently displayed on 776 pages and should have been expanded to 400 more.  Maybe the users wielding paragraphs and guidelines will take care of the completion of these projects, but from what I've seen I'm not very optimistic. Thanks everybody for watching. Good bye.`"

Why would you sit on your hands 'doubting' when the TRUTH is a few click away? Are you BLINDLY on his side or are you a fair person? Why not have a look? The truth has NO HOLES EVER!!  Ryulong HAS been bullying and tried very hard to keep a false QUOTE on the JEREMY CLARKSON page. Using sock puppets I was able to force him through the aid of other editors, to acquire the ACTUAL quote and SOURCE it... what a criminal I am huh?!  Ryulong on the other hand, repeatedly deleted my DISCUSSION TOPIC in his attempt to place the FALSE INCEST statement on the page.  If you are going to quote someone claiming that they've made jokes about INCEST, then you should back it up with a source.  Isn't WIKIPEDIA about accuracy and integrity?  It's all there in black and white.  Also - I did not email tons of users... I left messages on approx 4 pages. I thought I was messaging people that had problems with the guy too. AFTER I did that, I discovered that the guy had been nominated for ADMIN... this was really bad news.  This all started with a group of Anti-American editors that PROTECT the Jeremy Clarkson page. Both incidents have since been corrected as I was relying on fact not ambigous anti-American information.  I am not a BULLY. I am not politically motivated. I am not a vandal. My issues have been about FACTUALISING the political works of crooked admin who abuse the 3rr rule and cite PERSONAL ATTACK REACTION as personal attack.  I hope you will actually look into this. You seem to have taken a great interest in it, why not be wholesome and fair and look into my claim?  Thanks for reading.  YourCousin     I'm honestly not here for a fight or debate, I just ask that you please look into what I've talked about (the bullying and dicscussion topic deleting) and let me know what you think.   I have a proper USERNAME with nearly 2,000 edits. If I use that to communicate with you or edit the Jeremy Clarkson page, the ADMIN and editors there follow you around undoing your work and getting their ADMIN buddies to block you. So I have special IDs for such pages. Sorry. They made it that way. I DO NOT VANDALISE.  Today, I tried to tell my VALID story on Ryulong's admin nomination page and his #3 supporter, MR LEFTY was there within 120 seconds to delete and censor my story. This is unfair. The whole vote is now unfair because of such censure.   If you are not crooked, then please at least tell me, ``YES, IT LOOKS LIKE HE DID THWART YOUR DISCUSSION AND TRY TO KEEP THE WRONG QUOTE IN THE PAGE``... that's all. That's how it all got started. I am 38 years old, I don't find INCEST as funny as Ryulong.  Please respond. I would appreciate it.  YourCousin    Ha ha... I've just noticed that you're from TEXAS...

Don't you recognize the Don't Mess With Texas attitude from me? LOOK AT THE REVERTS!  This all started because the page said that YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PASSPORT to buy a drink in USA and that machine guns are legal. This pissed me off because Anti American people in Britain thrive on this mis-information.   My revert war with Ryulong was down to him wanting to keep a statement that said that ALL AMERICANS HAVE INCEST.. the quote was false, but he went al great lengths to keep it, stating that it didnt need a source.  I think that if you say that someone else said that an entire COUNTRY(THE USA) has incest, that you should have to back it up. Isn't Wikipedia about FACT and ITEGRITY?  The page now has the real quote which is not much better but at least it does not say it about ALL AMERICANS and at least it's a real quote with a real source!  DUDE!! LOOK AT THE PAGE! PLEASE!!!

If we consider a ``gas`` as one model and an ``Ideal Gas`` as another then we can see where the two correlate (under what conditions they correlate). Whether they correlate more at ``sufficiently low pressure`` is fine but thats not what I'm trying to explain in the article. The model for an ``Ideal Gas`` has is own conditions and assumptions, thats the only thing I'm trying to display in the method of writing this article. Most people confuse the concept of an Ideal Gas and other simplifications of gases with the actual gas itself. Basically, I'm trying to have people say ``This gas behaves as an Ideal Gas under these conditions`` instead of ``This gas is an Ideal Gas``. I don't have any issue with your equations, I don't understand where that brings any more clarity to the statement.     :: Also, deviations from the ``Ideal Gas model`` is not necessarily just phase-changes or chemical reactions. I can theoretically squeeze enough gas into a container to where intermolecular forces would become significant enough to where the gas deviates from the ideal model. (this is just one example)   `"

0,"`lol. Regardless of intent or accident - I actually wish that GoingBatty would listen to my request and avoid pages that I'm working on. GoingBatty was (and still is) not interested in  Brazilian Hip Hop unless he's a secret gangster rapper. Maybe after a hard day in the hood with his scout charges this scoutmaster relaxes by expressing himself through rap. Anyway I'm bored by him and a whole bunch of other editors - all of whom seem to be here either as incognito moralists, conservatives, protectors of childhood, nationalists, etc. I imagine that many of the neo-nazi groups are here also. Its my experience of right-wingers that on the whole they don't want you to know what they are up too. I remember an arts center open mic night which I was attending being infiltrated by five or six or them. It was a surreal situation because none of them were actually musicians - they pretended to be comedians which allowed them the right to attend and perform. The woman who ran the night and who had no idea of how the BNP (British National Party) worked had put one of them in charge. I emailed the arts center due to the fact that I knew some of the people who ran the open mic nights (including the woman who had been put in overall charge and had made the decision to put him in charge) and got an email back saying the open mic nights were for everyone regardless of their political views. A week or two later I received another email saying that the arts center had decided to separate the comedy from the music by having separate nights for both. I'm  not too sure why but I do know that at one of the open mic nights the leader of this small BNP cell had been put in charge and after one of the singers had finished (she was colored) he said something that was really strange. I can't say what because people who were there may be reading this but it was racist. About a hundred people witnessed and heard what he said and everyone just sat silently in shock not knowing how to react - after all he was in charge. Now that is power. When you can persuade others that your intent is one thing and then position yourself to impose your will or views upon those who believe your original lie - well that is political power. Its not even a right wing thing since many left wing leaders have used to same ploy. It is the nature of a dogmatic personality who is seeking power to follow such a course when faced with opposition to their dogma. Here's what happened after the torrent scene released the membership list of the BNP and I spotted that one of them was a town planning consultant employed by my local council. I sent an email to my council of course. Evidently my council believe that hiring a BNP member as a town planning consultant for one of the most highly diverse ethnic towns in England was fine because his racist views shouldn't affect his ability to provide good advice. lol      *Sicko.

I do not understand why you are undoing links to the 'year in literature' articles, and to the 'year in British television' articles.  It took me time to get each book in its proper year, and to make sure the television adaptations were correctly described as to series, episode and year, and matching that overall page as well as IMDb information.  Not every novel was adapted for television. So I put those links back, for consistency across The Cadfael Chronicles articles in Wikipedia, the 20 novels and one short story collection.    Is this some new rule in Wikipedia, though the articles for the year in literature and year in television still exist?    *There is general consensus that [[Year in Topic|2000]] used in the way they were in those articles constitutes easter eggs and should be avoided.

0,"`  === Constantine II as pretender ===  Is your objection to the word Pretender, or is it something more substantive?  I'm just asking, as I have no objection to your edit either way.  I believe that we use the term 'Pretender' far too easily.  In our article on the concept, we say: ``The term pretender is applied to those persons on whose behalf a claim to a throne is advanced, regardless of whether that person himself actually makes an active claim.``  While that may be a valid use of the term in a specialist work devoted to royalty, I think that it is misleading in a general work.  But perhaps you are objecting in some other way?  I am just curious.    : My posting ``citation needed``, pertaining to the article ``Constantine of Greece`` and not to the article ``Pretender``, is not an objection but rather a suggestion of a citation to perhaps support the claim that Constantine II is a pretender as it is, as you say, used ``far too easily``.    `"

Okinawa is NOT another country anymore; the Okinawan tongue is a dialect of Japanese, like it or not (it was established so by the government years ago, after carrying out extensive linguistic research, and realizing the grammar is the same) (Palau, Korean, and Ainu are clearly not related). I can't understand how Wikipedia can let a soldier, a brutish animal without intelligence, closer to the neanderthal than to the homo sapiens, have more authority editing articles than an expert in the subject. And you Americans are clearly the most retarded people on Earth. Now I see why Americans in Japan can only get the ugliest and most retarded women out there.

Did Lord Nimmo Smith have any sources when he declared Rangers 'In Common Speech were capable of being owned and operated'? No because he was giving his opinion. Had he been using the Law then he could not possibly say that the Club outwith could be owned and operated. If you notice the part on 'Liquidation of Rangers' I wrote on this page, it also said 'in many people's eyes declared the Old Firm tag as redundant'. The liquidation of Rangers and it's impact on any 'Old Firm' terminology should be installed on that page for people to get the full picture.

All those experienced fringe editors who have left this page are well used to working with them, and the results have been good for the project.

0,"` :::::::I MUST object to this. When I originally put forth my version of MastCell and Nightscream's ``argument``, I was told I was not addressing the article, but just babbling on the issue. So, I defended myself that this is directly related to the article and its POV. Then, I was told, that somehow paraphrasing the argument used to push POV is somehow an ``attack`` on the editors!! And that I ``misattributed`` them. Fine, I'll deal with that later. Okay, so let me get this straight. People push a POV on an article. They use specific arguments to justify pushing their POV (the endless bickering over ``scientific consensus``, ``scientific community``, ``facts``, ``who is a scientist``, just read the last 3 years' discussion pages). I come onto this discussion page, and I point out how pathetic their arguments used to push their POV are. When I do this, I am told I am ``not addressing the article to improve it``, and that I'm ``attacking the editors`` (!!) and that if I continue to do this, I will be banned. Whatever. Nightscream said: ``I made none of the ``arguments`` you attributed to me, nor do I recall MastCell doing so either.`` But you said: ``It indicates that it is referring exclusively to those who follow the Scientific Method, and not any ol' Tom, Dick and Harry with a contrary opinion and a webpage.`` It does not take a ph.d. to figure out that by ``any ol' Tom, Dick, and Harry with a contrary opinion and a webpage`` you mean Duesberg, Perth, David Crowe, AIDS Wiki, and Virusmyth, and all the people associated with them. Hence, by your own words, you are saying that all these people, the ``Tom, Dick, and Harry``'s, are not following the ``scientific method`` and are thus not part of your ``scientific community``. And this is my point. You DEFINE anyone who rejects the hypothesis as necessarily not following scientific method, hence not a member of the scientific community, then claim there's 100% or near 100% agreement in the scientific community that HIV causes AIDS. It's a completely circular argument.   `"

As to how to deal with editors like this... It can be tricky, and the response depends on the balance of good, bad and indifferent edits. If there are a significant number of good edits, might be best just to keep a good eye on the contribs and revert the bad ones. If you find yourself continually reverting the same bad ones then a block for disruption might be in order. That may or may not have the effect of getting them to discuss things.  "

Notice, it says ``Persian-born`` in parantheses, and gives Islamic as the nationality. Basically, they defined him by religion and stated his place of birth. He was born in Khwarizm, in the Khorasan province. At the time of his birth, it was part of the Arab Islamic Caliphate, now it's part of the Uzbegistan nation-state. Alas, Persians burnt us saying that it's in fact Persian, so let's take it as Persian. Now, according to sources cited by Heja Helwada, Khorasan in general had a huge Arab population. In accordance to that, defining him as Persian simply because he was born in Khorasan, is not only disputed at best, it also constitutes OR(original research) which is against Wiki's policy, see: WP:NOR  A troll showed up lately and claimed that Arabs are fighting a losing battle, I'm not sure we're in a battle-field here, but I got the gist: he thinks we have no sources...poor little guy!

Digital would only describe that the lighting is controlled digitally. This has absolutely no effect on the actual light and thus no effect on the image. If I'm not mistaken, lightening would refer to processing to increase the brightness of shadows, which increases the noise as both noise and the signal is boosted (signal to noise ratio remains the same). I'm not sure if there could be a better word than ``lightening`` though. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to explain where the original noise in the shadow comes from, and I'm not sure if this could be consider a ``true`` noise source as it looks like its simply boosting already present noise.

I have gone out of my way to provide detailed information on sources and where those sources can be located. In contrast the sources quoted by Jdorney are not only dubious, but are not at all supported by the majority of authors and historians. Jdorney uses two main sources...CAIN and Lost Lives. CAIN is a ``estimation`` at best, and the US State Dept. Jane's Intelligence, British  Human Rights Watch, the Council On Foreign Relations, and various books and articles...all take issue with CAIN's facts and figures. As for Lost Lives, I have the latest edition of that book, and Jdorney completey fabricates the figures. If one reads carefully from 1969-2005, they see the number given as 86, shown as the amount of UDA and UVF members killed by IRA and INLA units. 85% of that number are given credit soley to the IRA. I wonder if jdorney even has the book, since he misquotes it so often. Similar numbers I have provided as to the number and units of British and Irish killed by the IRA is similarly backed up by Lost Lives...if one actually takes the time to read it throughly. I am not going to respond to any more whiney, and childish messages by jdorney. I have informed Wikipedia staff about his biased and unprofessional behavior, and have recieved back that Wikipedia will look into it. It is sad that Wikipedia has to be hampered by a few biased, purposely innacurate Editors, who ignore facts and make up their own...just to support their own one sided views.  PS. Jdorney can leave more messages for me if he wants, but I will not respond to them, and all will be forwarded to Wikipedia staff for review.  I will also continue to monitor the IRA article and this article, to ensure that the correct facts are not continually changed, by a editor, who I doubt will be with Wikipedia much longer:)`"

Armed police are not common, even in London.

Why NJGW?  ???  ...the Nixon administration decided to try to ensure that international financial relations should be taken out of the control of state Central Banks and should be increasingly centred upon private financial operators. It sought to achieve this goal through exploiting US control over  international oil supplies.   It is still widely believed that the sharp and steep increase in oil prices  in 1973 was carried out by the Gulf states as part of an anti-Israel and anti-US policy connected to the Yom Kippur war.    Yet as we now know, the oil price rises were the result of US influence on the oil states and they were arranged in part as an exercise in economic statecraft directed against America’s ‘allies’ in Western Europe and Japan. And another dimension of the Nixon administration’s policy on oil price rises was to give a new role, through them, to the US private banks in international financial relations.  The Nixon administration was planning to get OPEC to greatly increase its oil prices a full two years before OPEC did so and as early as 1972 the Nixon administration planned for the US private banks to recycle the petrodollars when OPEC finally did take US advice and jack up oil prices.    The Nixon administration understood the way in which the US state could use  expanding private financial markets as a political multiplier of the impact of US Treasury moves with the dollar. But according to the Nixon’s Ambassador in Saudi Arabia at the time, the principal political objective behind Nixon’s drive for the OPEC oil price rise was to deal a crippling blow to the Japanese and European economies, both overwhelmingly dependent on Middle East Oil, rather than to decisively transform international financial affairs.   Nevertheless , Nixon’s officials  showed far more strategic insight into the consequences of what they were attempting than most political scientists would credit any government with. Its capacity for deception both over the oil price rise and in the way in which it manipulated discussions with its ‘allies’ in the IMF over so-called ‘international monetary reform’ was brilliant.  The US government realised that the oil price rises would produce an enormous increase in the dollar earnings of oil states that could not absorb such funds into their own productive sectors.  At the same time, the oil price rises would plunge very many states into serious trade deficits as the costs of their oil imports soared. So the so-called petrodollars would have to be recycled from the Gulf through the Western banking systems to non-oil-producing states.  Other governments had wanted the petrodollars to be recycled through the  IMF.  But the US rejected this, insisting  the Atlantic world’s private banks (at that time led by American banks) should be the recycling vehicles. And because the US was politically dominant in the Gulf, it could get its way...   - The Globalization Gamble: The Dollar-Wall Street Regime and its Consequences By Peter Gowan  http://www.iwgvt.org/files/9-gowan.rtf  http://www.marxsite.com/Global%20Gamble2.htm http://www.amazon.com/Global-Gamble-Washingtons-Faustian-Dominance/dp/1859842712       'I am 100 per cent sure that the Americans were behind the increase in the price of oil.   - Sheikh Yamani, Former Saudi Oil Minister  http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2001/jan/14/globalrecession.oilandpetrol  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Zaki_Yamani   V.H.Oppenheim: “Why Oil Prices Go Up?

I will, since you are skeptical, but any book on the general subject will have them. Edison was not the first to develop a practical electric lighting system. Darwin was not the first to speculate on evolution. In each case it was the individual genius in developing the system which makes for the historical importance. Almost every element in Gutenberg's invention had been used in Europe before, though probably not type-casting, however he may have done it. But it was he who printed the 42 line Bible, and that is the key cultural event.   ::Everyone's legacy needs readjustent in subsequent centuries, but usually the core remains, as it does here.  The earlier parallel development in East Asia was of great importance to those civilizations as well, and a great demonstration of successful human ingenuity in dealing with what one might have though intractible material (the Chinese characters). it is worth its own discussion, but not in an article about Gutenberg. (We can discuss separately its relevance to the article on the general history of typography.)  ``May have heard`` is not proof of influence, especially if that is the strongest statment a scholarly specialist can make, but on his authority warrants a reference and a paragraph.   I know how to word the above in a positive way, and I will, probably next week, if the article is not dismembered by then.

My question is this: How can you merge or even delete an article when there are three articles of the same person?  1.)Abdul Rauf Aliza 2.)Abdul Rauf (Taliban governor) 3.)Abdul Rauf (ISIS recruiter)  The last two articles should be deleted, as they have the least amount of content in them. How can I do this??   "

0,"Although this article does quite well to make clear the theoretical distinction between dialect and diatype, I don't think the example given of AAVE fits very well. AAVE could be a diatype just as well as a dialect; some speakers of AAVE (like myself) do not use it at all in daily life. Thoughts?  "

Or are you a self-appointed, sad individual who cannot 'make-it' in the real world and feels that you must be the 'big guy' on the internet? You are the epitome of what is wrong with Wikipedia.   The fact that this comment has been undone and there re threats to 'ban' its author rather proves the point: no comment can be made against the Wikipedia 'Nazis.' If you remove this comment then you are proving my point. Just comment on it and say I am wrong, rather than the sinister and clearly controlling approach you take. Retain my views and comment upon them here rather than be controlling. I may be wrong but as it stands you conform to the stereotype of the sexless, right-wing, American madmen who control Wikipedia. What kick do you get out of your control - is it sexual or poiitical? You have proved me right by deleting my commments.   "

I have been absolutely transparent about my reasoning and motives and I am very happy with the work I've done here. I am most proud that I have stood up against some of the worst admin abuse, dishonest and harassment by POV pushers like Drmies and other dishonest characters that abuse Wikipedia to advance their personal point of view and gang up on people they disagree with me. Your ridiculous ``associate professor is no more notable than a professor`` commentary is a perfect example. You want to be held in high esteem and to be highly respected. But respect is earned Drmies and there is very little about your behavior or how you treat others that merits respect. You should stop drinking so much and reflect on who you are as a person.

1,"` March 2007 (UTC)  The only vandal here is you. Let me clefify some things 4 you,  In the 19th century Ilija Garasanin and the rest of the Serb goverment of that time formed a program called ``Nacertanije``, it was a plan of how to realize the plan of a Great Serbia  on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. This new state would be rulled by Serbs, others would be subjected while Muslims(of any ethnicity) would be distroyed(by genocide sense it´s the only way). They called there Army chetnik, them selfs chetniks and there by this ideology(which is fashist) is chetnik. And any1 who follows it is a chetnik.  The plan failed untill 1918 when the Serbs managed to create a ``Slavic Kingdom`` which was actually ment to become a Serb Kingdom which was with time shown, during WWII the chetniks allied with the Nazis and commited GENOCIDE. After the death of Tito the chetniks ressurected and tried everyting all over again but ones again failed thank God.  Now, the chetnik PROPAGANDA is used to make Serbs think that it is right to do all that and to foole everybothy else, this propaganda includes showing Bosnia as a ``Serb state``, Bosniaks as  ``Serbs``, spreding Islamophobia and Anti-Bosniak settlment or presenting the Serbs as the victoms and so on. THAT site does all that and it is enough to open it and you will see. Now you ain´t nobody so I don´t have to proove anything if you don´t see it then you are either stupid or a chetnik your self.  15:59, 29`"

1,"  :::So ban me, bully.  Wield your banhammer for great justice.  Get your kicks out of it.  And don't bother to check any facts at all.  I am sure you feel really good for defending someone who you presume is female.  What would happen if Helen was male?  Would you still blindly defend someone who was adding in inaccurate information if they were male?  What if I was female?  You don't know.  I could be a supermodel.  Anyway, enjoy your power trip.  Wikipedia is so terrible.  Wikipedia doesn't care about accurate information.  All they care about are people like you on massive power trips.  So go ahead, feel good about yourself.

1,"Ringerfan23: I just want you to let you know that you appear to alienate a lot of people on Wikipedia. Perhaps the problem can be best summarized by your own comment on this page when you said that you thought about the issue and came to agree with the rest of the group. In light of your failure to think about the issue in advance, your actions were shameful. When faced with a group of people who reached consensus, you still had the audacity to have the page locked to reflect your (poorly reasoned) point of view. These are the actions of a stubborn child who wants his way and completely contradictory to what Wikipedia is about. I think you should grow up, recognize that your positions are often incorrect, and defer to the democratic process. Seriously, why do you think your opinion is so important that your beliefs should outweigh a consensus?  "

It's unfortunate. I can only imagine the many contributors in this world who want to add to this article (or have added), but find their work deleted in a month. Notice also how you are so obsessed with the rules and scrutinizing other peoples work on Trance, yet you've added next to nothing to the article yourself?

Although Cena is a good entertainer, quite frankly he is the worst wrestler I have seen in my life, and as for him having a World Title reignI think it is absolutely preposterous. He shouldn't even be in the WWEOVW should suit his mediocre, half baked, sloppy wrestling style better. ( )"

What more do you want, Editor-Fag? Obviously, I can't argue with compulsive editor-fags like you. Fine, delete it, and the Image:Forge of War1.jpg one. I'm just trying to add images to help the community on wikipedia to improve the articles that call for pictures. I see it that it does comply to all of the image policies, except perhaps that one ``resolution`` rule, but, then again, if you've got a problem with it, then you can easily solve it yourself.

BUT YOUR SO RIGHT THAT THE QUANTAS INCIDENT IS LESS SERIOUS, THAT IS WHY THE NEXT DAY THE RYANAIR PLANE WAS FLYING AGAIN AND THE QANTAS FLIGHT WAS GETTING THE HOLE IN THE SIDE OF FUSELAGE FIXED)   HARRY MORE PEOPLE LIKE YOU SHOULD FOR THE FAA, IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER ``YEAH I KNOW I WAS DRUNK WHILE I WAS FLYING, BUT NOBODY GOT HURT.``   `"
1,"`  What is Wikipedia? I fuck you and your fucking wikipedia in the ass. I am tired with your shit! I try to make the page ``Aromanians`` better and much more real. I am Aromanian and i know better what we are, not your fucking wikipedia. You want to have a good wikipedia? This is not good wikipedia, this is shit, to much informations are not real!`"
1,"       Some Peoples on Here are stupid Idiots and Arrogant. I know what I am doing and what I am editing. I give them Sources and Reliable ones but they won't listen to the Crap I give them. These peoples are so bias. I guess i rue, They do give out false information.    "
1,"  You know what else I know being completely unacceptable to all perceived academical practice? Blatant POV-pushing being obstinately reintroduced without opposition.  Since common reasoning with such a character, infused with a classic case of cognitive dissonance, is an impossibility, I will address that person in any shape or form I deem effective and necessary. He is not only an asshole, he is an asshole a thousand times over.  If one random person on the Internet can take academical precedence on a matter of Iranistics, over an editorial board of acclaimed scholars of a specialist compendia who has approved of the referential value of the paper, then it does nothing more than expose the ultimate flaw of Wikipedia; that any idiot can edit the content in order to suit it to their own personal agendas and to boot castigate sources on extremely weak premises. Now that is rude.  So, you know what, being blocked from editing doesn't really mean shit to me. Make it a perma-ban if you wish.  "

1,"`  ==You're right, I do want to complain about you== Not really you in particular, but the way Wiki is run & the people who enforce it..the people like you.  It's really fucking pathetic that Wikipedia is run this way.  If Wikipedia ignores truths, and only sources ``reliable`` articles..then it can't be cited at all for being true.  If an article basis their opinion off of something unreliable, does that make them unreliable as well?  What if they're a reliable source.  Or what if that reliable source is reporting on something completely untrue?  Doesn't matter apparently, does it.  Fuck that, and fuck the people who uphold this.  So in short, fuck you.  [:    `"
